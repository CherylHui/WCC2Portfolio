                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Audience can enter the meditation booth to spend sometime with themselves and meditate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During the meditation, interactive audiovisual elements will be projected into the meditation booth,</p>  
                <br>
                <p>the scent of lavender will also come out of the booth and meditative music will be played during the meditation.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>This project is an installation which I took meditation as an inspiration. In the past few years, I was struggling with depression and I learnt to meditate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I found that meditation helps a lot in controlling my emotion and improving self awareness. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Also, I found that self-love is one of the ways to overcome mental challenges.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I have been living in Hong Kong and now in London, both of the cities are very vibrant, people get used to busy lives and forgot about taking care of themselves.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Therefore, I decided to create an installation which people can take some time to do a very short meditation and at the same time raising the awareness of self love.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the music creation part, I have studied about the Solfeggio frequencies. </p>
                <br>
                <p>These frequencies are specific tones that claimed to be beneficial towards the mind and body in specific ways.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

                <!-- example of styling for three images, you can write your own styling -->
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-two">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/WaveHeartBeat.png"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/ColorWave.png"/>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>From technical aspect, this project can mainly divided into three parts, serial communication between Arduino and p5.js, audio analysis and audio reactive graphics.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The serial communication between Arduino and p5.js sends heartbeat rate data to the sketch and responsible for the colour change of the graphics. During the design</p>
                <br>
                <p>process, I have tried to use the heartbeat rate data for the rotation of the graphic. However, the effect was not satisfying. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Therefore, I decided to use the heartbeat rate to determine the colour of the graphics.</p>
                <br>
                
                <!-- example of styling for three images, you can write your own styling -->
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-half">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/repeating-diagonal-lines-rect.jpeg"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/repeating-diagonal-lines-rect.jpeg"/>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The audio analysis process utilised the FFT function. The function divided the audio file into 5 different spectrum, the bass, lowMid, Mid, highMid and tremble.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I utilised the data for the transformation of the graphics.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the same time, the graphic rotates according to the frame rate to create an illusion of 3D graphics.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, a GUI is added to help with matching the colour for the projection and also mirroring the text.</p>

                <p>Reflect on how the project went, what went well, what you learnt etc. Based on these reflections, conclude with how you would further develop this project if you were to make another version or how you would further develop your ideas.</p>
