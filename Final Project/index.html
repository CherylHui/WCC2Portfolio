                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>This project is an installation which I took meditation as an inspiration. In the past few years, I was struggling with depression and I learnt to meditate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I found that meditation helps a lot in controlling my emotion and improving self awareness. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Also, I found that self-love is one of the ways to overcome mental challenges.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I have been living in Hong Kong and now in London, both of the cities are very vibrant, people get used to busy lives and forgot about taking care of themselves.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Therefore, I decided to create an installation which people can take some time to do a very short meditation and at the same time raising the awareness of self love.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the music creation part, I have studied about the Solfeggio frequencies. </p>
                <br>
                <p>These frequencies are specific tones that claimed to be beneficial towards the mind and body in specific ways.
                </p>
