                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Audience can enter the meditation booth to spend sometime with themselves and meditate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During the meditation, interactive audiovisual elements will be projected into the meditation booth,</p>  
                <br>
                <p>the scent of lavender will also come out of the booth and meditative music will be played during the meditation.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>This project is an installation which I took meditation as an inspiration. In the past few years, I was struggling with depression and I learnt to meditate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I found that meditation helps a lot in controlling my emotion and improving self awareness. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Also, I found that self-love is one of the ways to overcome mental challenges.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I have been living in Hong Kong and now in London, both of the cities are very vibrant, people get used to busy lives and forgot about taking care of themselves.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Therefore, I decided to create an installation which people can take some time to do a very short meditation and at the same time raising the awareness of self love.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the music creation part, I have studied about the Solfeggio frequencies. </p>
                <br>
                <p>These frequencies are specific tones that claimed to be beneficial towards the mind and body in specific ways.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <br>
                
                <p>From technical aspect, this project can mainly divided into three parts, serial communication between Arduino and p5.js, audio analysis and audio reactive graphics.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The serial communication between Arduino and p5.js sends heartbeat rate data to the sketch and responsible for the colour change of the graphics. During the design</p>
                <br>
                <p>process, I have tried to use the heartbeat rate data for the rotation of the graphic. However, the effect was not satisfying. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Therefore, I decided to use the heartbeat rate to determine the colour of the graphics.</p>
                <br>
                
                <!-- example of styling for two images, you can write your own styling -->
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-half">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/WaveHeartBeat.png"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/ColorWave.png"/>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The audio analysis process utilised the FFT function. The function divided the audio file into 5 different spectrum, the bass, lowMid, Mid, highMid and tremble.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I utilised the data for the transformation of the graphics.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the same time, the graphic rotates according to the frame rate to create an illusion of 3D graphics.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, a GUI is added to help with matching the colour for the projection and also mirroring the text.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Instead of employing VR and AR techniques, I would like the audience to carry out the meditation in the reality instead of using a headset or holding a phone or other devices. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Therefore, I chose to develop this installation with physical objects and also a heartbeat rate sensor for the audience to focus on their breathing as well as heartbeats.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the same time, the graphic rotates according to the frame rate to create an illusion of 3D graphics.</p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>During the creation process of the meditation booth, I stretched my limit quite a lot. </p>
                <br>
                <p>In graphics design wise, I learnt to employ polar coordinates in my drawing, utilising </p>
                <br>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p>mathematics properties such as sin and cos to create some symmetric and smooth edges graphics.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-single">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                <img src="../assets/images/Flower.png"/>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <p>Nevertheless, I learnt to create glowing graphics by adding shadow to the drawing. This allows me to create some drawing with mellower feeling than rigid lines and curves only.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-single">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                <img src="../assets/images/glow.png"/>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Apart from the design, the construction of the booth is also challenging, I have refined my design and gave up on using projector in the end.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Here is the initial design for the meditation booth, I planned to project the images from the side of the meditation booth and onto a holographic film. </p>
                <br>
                <p>However, the mapping becomes really difficult as the sides of the box may block out some of the projections. </p>
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-half">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                <img src="../assets/images/box.png"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/Updated Design.png"/>
                            </div>
                </div>
                <p>Therefore, I changed the projection into using the Pepper ghost method using the iPad as the light source and a clear plastic film for the images to form on. </p>
                <br>
                <p>These are the footages of experimenting with the set up and the updated design.</p>
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-single">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                <img src="../assets/images/pepperghost.png"/>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>If I have a chance to further develop this project, I would like to expand this meditation and self caring series into different form of installation as well as performances.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Firstly, I would like to apply the audio reactive images in sound bath setting. Which I think having</p>
                <br>
                <p>some visual aids may help people who are not used to calm themselves through meditative methods to try and experience the peaceful moments</p>
                <br>
                <p>Nevertheless, I think we may also further develop this 2D design into a 3D ones and create an immersive soundscape as well via 3JS.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This may allows me to further develop the 3JS environment during the mid-term project.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Lastly, I would like to build some more physical set up that is controlled by the heartbeat of the audience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For example, a beater may hit some singing bowls or gongs according to the biometric data collected from the audience, to provide a personal meditative environment.</p>
